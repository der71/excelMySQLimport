# excelMySQLimport

Small program to import excel data into MySQL.
1. Make sure all your excel files have to currect format. *main.py* shows which columns the code expects to find.
1. Put the excels you wish to import into the data folder.
1. While importing it prints some information to check if something went wrong with your import.

## Example files

There are 2 example files to run after all your data is in the excel database.
1. *show_example.py* selects data and plots it in a graph.
1. *show_example2.py* selects data and print it in a table. This is better achiefed with tools as phpmyadmin, hence why this is just an example.
